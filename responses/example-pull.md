Welcome to Getting started with GitHub Apps
We're going to work together to learn about GitHub Apps! We'll do this in this repository, which is a collection of resources - games to be specific. Before we start using real GitHub applications, let's get some foundations out of the way.

New to GitHub?
For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the Introduction to GitHub course.

Application vs GitHub Application
There are many types of applications, like the apps you might have on your phone. In this course, we'll focus on GitHub Applications, apps designed to work on GitHub.

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality through webhooks and GitHub's APIs. GitHub Apps act as top-layer tools that you can use to customize and automate routine processes.

Please note that GitHub Apps are very different from OAuth Apps. These have a different installation flow and have different rules around how they handle their data and access. If you'd like to learn more, check out the documentation
